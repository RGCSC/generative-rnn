#Generating HTML from within Python is not fun, and actually pretty cumbersome because you have to do the
#HTML escaping on your own to keep the application secure. Because of that Flask configures the Jinja2 template engine 
#for you automatically.
#requests are objects that flask handles (get set post, etc)
from flask import Flask, render_template,request

#initalize our flask app
app = Flask(__name__)


@app.route('/')
def index():
	#initModel()
	#render out pre-built HTML file right on the index page
	return render_template("index.html")

if __name__ == "__main__":
	#decide what port to run the app in
	port = int(os.environ.get('PORT', 5000))
	#run the app locally on the givn port
	app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=port)
	#optional if we want to run in debugging mode
	#app.run(debug=True)
